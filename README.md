#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering refers to the engineering methods or ways in which you use to create softwares, develop them, maintain them and deploy them. Software engineering is important in the technology industry because it brings about the creation of software applications the enable communication in modern aspects of life, not just communication, it is used in commerce and businesses, entertainment and healthcare.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. Development of high-level programming languages: This is between the years (1950s-1960s), in this stage there was the development of programming languages like FORTAN and COBOL which mllowed programmers to write code in a more abstarct way using human readable syntax.
2. Structured programming (1970s): It promoted breaking down large software systems into smaller and manageable modules as it reduces the complexity of code
3. Rise of Agile methodologies: It focused on customer collaboration, rapid prototyping, and adaptive planning. It allowed development teams to respond to changing requirements and deliver incremental improvements in software, accelerating the pace of development and fostering better alignment with user needs.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
 - Requirements: Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
  - Design: Creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
  - Implementation: Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
  - Testing: Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
  - Deployment: Releasing the software to users or customers.
  - Maintenance: Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
  -Waterfall: Sequential approach with distinct phases (e.g., requirements, design, implementation) flowing downwards like a waterfall.
  - Agile: Iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration, and responding to change.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
A software developer is responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions. A quality assurance engineer is responsible for ensuring the software quality by designing and executing test plans. A project manager oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
The IDE are Software suites that provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing code (e.g., Visual Studio, Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA) while VCS are Software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members (e.g., Git, Subversion)

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
  - Changing Requirements: Requirements may change during the development cycle, leading to scope creep and project delays.
  - Tight Deadlines: Pressure to deliver software products on schedule can result in rushed development and compromised quality.
  - Technical Debt: Accrued from shortcuts or suboptimal solutions, technical debt can impede future development efforts and increase maintenance costs.
Strategies for Overcoming Challenges: Strategies for overcoming challenges include effective communication, agile methodologies, prioritization of tasks, and regular reassessment of project goals and timelines.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Importance of Testing: Testing is a critical aspect of QA and involves various types of testing, including:
  - Unit Testing: Testing individual components or modules of software.
  - Integration Testing: Testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
  - System Testing: Testing the entire software system as a whole.
  - Acceptance Testing: Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is all about crafting questions pr statements to get the best answer you need from AI modles. Adding context or being concise and specific enabke the AI model to give you the best answer and understand you request better. It helps improve the interaction between humans and AI.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Prompt: Types of coffee
- types of coffee in Asia
- 10 types of coffee in Asia
- 10 types of coffee in Asia: south Korea

The improved prompt specifies the plce, continent and the list. using the number, I am able to tell the AI sepciifically how mnay coffees i want listed
